# data-engineering-rust-course

## Overview
Place to store student code/projects for the duration of the Rust data
engineering course.

This repository will be extended throughout the course with each Lab or
exercise added with (hopefully), this README being extended with a brief
overview of the code additions.

### Structure
My content for each week of the course will contained in a `Week#` directory
with assignments or explorations within subdirectories.

### Lab Goal

Set up a reusable and automated sandbox environment to store student code and
projects for the duration of the Rust data engineering course.
